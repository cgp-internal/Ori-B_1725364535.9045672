Flask Application README
=========================

This is a basic Flask application that displays "Hello World" when run.

How to Run
-----------

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `./run.sh` in your terminal.
3. Once the dependencies are installed, the Flask app will start automatically.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the "Hello World" page.

Note: The `run.sh` script installs Python, installs the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`, and runs the Flask app.
